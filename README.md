# es_service - services

elasticsearch 2.X.X can use it


Testing environment:
Linux           (centos 6.4)
elasticsearch   (2.3.4)

I wanna the elasticsearch 2.X.X can easyly to start just like a servies

------ 1 step ------

becuase when the elasticsearch update to 2.X.X version it can not start with root

so you need to create a user,and give the elasticsearch permission to start it


------ 2 step ------

set the elasticsearch path

enter the profile 'vi /etc/profile' to set the user and ES path
